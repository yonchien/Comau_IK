# Inverse kinematics algorithm for a 6 DOF robotic arm

*by Jorge Salamanca, March 2018.*

Implementation of an inverse kinematics algorithm for a 6 degrees-of-freedom robotics arm, based on its Denavit-Hartenberg parameters and its subsequent geometric Jacobian determination. To verify the algorithm is working well, the robot's kinematic chain is graphed after every iteration, allowing us to visualize its movement.
